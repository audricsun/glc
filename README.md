I am running administrator role for my teams, and it's time wasting to browse and click for create/update roles/projects or setup webhooks/intetgrations for Gitlab projects. Though there are few choices but none of them seems handy enough for me. Let's see if I can make a better one on my own.

> This whole project is built based on the Gitlab administration practice from my work. Not sure if this is a good practice, but it works for my place.

# Roadmap
1. [ ] Multi-level commands/sub-commands design
2. [ ] Configuration management
3. [ ] API wrapper for Gitlab
4. [ ] First Demo for create conf from remote over `gli fetch`
5. [ ] When all above are done. Then i will think about it.
