## Background
I am running administrator role for my teams, and it's time wasting to browse and click for create/update roles/projects or setup webhooks/intetgrations for Gitlab projects. Though there are few choices but none of them seems handy enough for me. Let's see if I can make a better one on my own.

> The whole project is built based on the Gitlab administration practice from my work.
